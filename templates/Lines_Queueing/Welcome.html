    Welcome, and thank you for participating!
</p>

<p>
    From now until the end of the experiment, please stay focused on the task at hand, as your payment highly depends on your performance in the experiment. 
    To respect other participants, please do not eat, play, chat, or leave the room during the experiment. 
    If you need to drink water or use your cellphone, please only do so when absolutely necessary. 
    If you have any questions, please send the host a private message. 
    Please also remember to open the session link with Chrome because other browsers may cause problems.
</p>

<p>
    During the experiment, you will earn points in each round. 
    At the end of the experiment, one round will be randomly chosen, from which your points will be converted to US dollars at the rate specified in the Zoom chat. 
    You are guaranteed a show-up fee of $4.00 but can earn considerably more.
